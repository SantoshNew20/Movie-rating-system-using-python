# Movie-rating-system-using-python
##Problem Statement:

#A movie review website needs to create a database to store their data and perform operations on it. Create a dummy model with 100 users and 1000 movies to explain how it will work.

##Topics Covered:
#- NumPy
    #- numpy.ndarray
    #- Statistical operations using NumPy
    #- Mathematical operations using NumPy

##Tasks to be performed:
#1. Generate 1000 movie IDs starting from 1301
#2. Create a matrix movies_matrix, to store users rating such that
    #- There are 100 users
    #- Each user can review as many movies as they want
    #- The review should be in between 0 to 10 (both inclusive)
#3. We have ten movie experts, let us take their reviews as well. 50 new movies and their reviews have to be added
#4. Create final_movie_rating matrix with four columns i.e., 'Movie ID', 'Average rating', 'Number of ratings', and 'Standard deviation of ratings'
#5. Convert the final movie ratings to have range from 0 to 10, such that the minimum rating converts to 0 and maximum to 10, and the other values in between
#6. Display the movies rating-wise, highest to lowest
